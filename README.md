# Visa-approval-prediction-EnsembleMethodsML
<p align="justify"> This project presents a ML based solution for hiring companies to identify candidates who would have a suitable profile and have a high probability to be certified for a visa. EDA and Data visualization were performed to identify key attributes that have a high degree of correlation with visa approval. A number of tree based models such as Decision Tree, Bagging classifier and Random Forest as well as Boosting methods (XGBoost, Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost) were explored. Model hyper-paramters for each of these models were also tuned to see if it improved performance. XGBoost and tuned Random Forest performed the best amongst all models with recall scores of 88-90% and F1 score of 83%. Feature importances determined from these models combined with the findings of EDA were utilized to identify key attributes that can predict whether visa will be certified or denied. A suitable profile for applicants whose visa have a high chance of approval were recommended. <\p>
